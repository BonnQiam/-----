Galaxy Design Platform
=============================

- The Galaxy Design Platform is a comprehensive solution for cellbased and custom IC implementation.
- Galaxy accepts design intent in industry standard formats and generates a production ready IC design in GDSII format.
- Galaxy RTL and Physical implementation products concurrently balance design constraints by performing intelligent tradeoffs between speed, area, power, test and yield.
- Galaxy Sign-off engines accurately model complex physical interactions to ensure signal and power integrity.
- Coherent algorithms for parasitic extraction and timing produce correlated results.
