===========

The actions involved to design an IC circuit can be grouped in different categories according to their types as different types of activities require different EDA tools

1. Synthesis tools —— increasing information about the design by providing more details (e.g. ``logic synthesis``,  ``physical synthesis`` )
2. Analysis & Verification tools
   
   * collecting information on the quality of the design (e.g. ``timing analysis`` )
   *  checking whether a synthesis step has left the specification intact (e.g., ``layout verification``).

3. Optimization tools —— increasing the quality of the design by rearrangements in a given description (e.g., ``logic optimizer``,  ``timing optimizer``)
4. Design management tools —— storage of design data, cooperation between tools, design flow, etc. (e.g., ``database``).
