定义设计环境
======================

就电路的环境属性、时序和负载在不同模块间的分配进行设定

设计环境
---------------------

.. math::
    Before a design can be optimized, you must **define the environment** in which the design is expected to operate. 

You define the environment by specifying:
 
- **operating condition** s : Operating conditions include temperature, voltage, and process variations
- **wire load model** s : Wire load models estimate the effect of wire length on design performance. System interface
- **system interface characteristic** s : characteristics include input drives, input and output loads, and fanout loads. 

The environment model directly affects design synthesis results.

P.S. In Design Compiler, the model is defined by a set of attributes and constraints that you
assign to the design
