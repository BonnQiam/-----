Optimization & Trade-off
============================

.. warning::
    Circuit design is a tradeoff of timing, power and area

Main Optimization ``Trade-Off`` s：
    - Timing optimization —— Goal: small delays，即通过时序优化以修复时序违例
    - Power optimization —— Goal: low power consumption
    - Area optimization —— Goal: small area
