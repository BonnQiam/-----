时钟规划
=========================

Although most ASIC designs use clock tree synthesis, clock tree synthesis
may not be sufficient for very high-performance and synchronized designs.

In this case, one needs to implement the distributed clock networks manually
in order to minimize the skew between communicating elements due to their
line resistance and capacitance.
