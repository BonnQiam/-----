<p><code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">liberty</span></code> library format（以 <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">.lib</span></code> 结尾） 是由 Synopsys 公司开发的用于描述物理单元的时序、功耗信息的重要库文件，为了保证数据的精确性多采用 <strong>非线性查找表</strong> 或 <strong>分段线性</strong> 的方法。 由于电路的延时、功耗是输入信号斜率与输出负载的函数，完整的查找表有一维、二维、三维三种形式，分别表示一元、二元、三元三种函数关系</p>
<p>EDA 工具会在库文件中查找最符合单元真实情况的数据进行延时、功耗计算</p>
